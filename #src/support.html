												This indicates the base isn’t reading the atomizer at all. Make sure each lead is making good contact with the gold contact pin and stainless-steel atomizer housing. Another step to try is pulling the gold contact pin located at the bottom of the atomizer. Use your fingernail to pull out the contact pin approximately 1mm-2mm. Extending the pin should help it make good contact within the base connection. Through usage, atomizers could be overtightened to the base causing the connection pin within the base to become sunken. Pulling the pin out on your atomizers helps quite a bit.

												This indicates that your peak is reading the atomizer but detects a short circuit within the atomizer. Verify both leads are not sticking out past the insulator or gold contact pin. Another common reason, if the leads are touching or within contact of one another and touching the “floor” of the stainless-steel chamber. The most common short circuit errors will be found underside of the coil base

												Disassemble the atomizer and verify leads are not making contact with one another and that both your bends are 90-degree angles. Only one lead should be making contact with the atomizer housing. Even the weight of some inserts can be enough to push the coil down to ground out against the bottom of the stainless-steel atomizer chamber.
